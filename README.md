# Offshore Oil Well Event Classification for the 2023 Geo-Data Contest
Welcome to our project repository for the [2023 Geo-Data Contest](http://www.geodata-con.kr/2023/index.php)! In this exciting contest, we're focusing on a critical task: classifying undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells. Our primary goal is to leverage advanced AI models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of event detection in these crucial environments.

## Contest and Dataset
The core objective of the 2023 Geo-Data Contest is to effectively categorize and predict undesirable events in offshore oil wells. To achieve this, we're harnessing the power of the [3W dataset](https://github.com/petrobras/3W), a comprehensive collection of observed data from offshore oil wells. This dataset provides us with a wealth of information to train and fine-tune our AI models, enabling us to make more informed decisions regarding well conditions and events.

## Models
We suggested 3 types of AI models to tackle the offshore well event classification challenge:

## 1. MLFC (Multi-Layer Fusion Classifier)
## (Accuracy: 0.99)
One of our standout achievements is the development of the MLFC (Multi-Layer Fusion Classifier) model, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach. This model is specifically tailored for classifying abnormal events using Computer Vision (CV) techniques. Leveraging the power of CNNs, MLFC extracts intricate spatial features from visual data to discern patterns related to undesirable events.
