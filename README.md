# Offshore Oil Well Event Classification for the 2023 Geo-Data Contest
Welcome to our project repository for the [2023 Geo-Data Contest](http://www.geodata-con.kr/2023/index.php)! In this exciting contest, we're focusing on a critical task: classifying undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells. Our primary goal is to leverage advanced AI models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of event detection in these crucial environments.

## Contest and Dataset
The core objective of the 2023 Geo-Data Contest is to effectively categorize and predict undesirable events in offshore oil wells. To achieve this, we're harnessing the power of the [3W dataset](https://github.com/petrobras/3W), a comprehensive collection of observed data from offshore oil wells. This dataset provides us with a wealth of information to train and fine-tune our AI models, enabling us to make more informed decisions regarding well conditions and events.

## Models
We proposed three distinct AI models, each tailored to address the complex task of offshore well event classification. Explore the detailed documentation for each model below:

## 1. MLFC (Multi-Layer Fusion Classifier) (Accuracy: 0.99)
One of our standout achievements is the development of the MLFC (Multi-Layer Fusion Classifier) model, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach.

## Results
We are delighted to announce that our efforts have led us to secure ***the runner-up position*** in the highly competitive 2023 Geo-Data Contest. This achievement stands as a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of our team, as well as the robustness of our AI models in addressing the intricate challenges of offshore oil well event classification.
